This Agreement can be concluded in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and German.

You may print or save a copy of the Agreement before submitting your application.</li>\
												<li class="iso-num-list-padding"><strong>Your Profile:</strong> You agree to provide Administrator with true, current and accurate information in your Program online account ("Profile"), including your name, address, telephone number, email address, driver\'s license and credit card information. You agree to promptly update your Profile or otherwise notify Administrator if any of the information contained in your Profile has changed. If you update your email address on your Profile at any time through a rental transaction, you agree that Administrator may rely on the updated email address for future communications under this Program. If your Membership Number or any credit card listed in your Profile (a) is lost, stolen or invalidated, (b) you suspect it is being used without your permission, or (c) expires, you will promptly notify Administrator. You agree that it is your responsibility to notify Administrator of any such changes and Administrator is entitled to rely upon any and all information provided by you and contained in your Profile as being current and accurate. You understand that the information contained in your Profile will be part of any rental agreement you conclude as a Member with Administrator\'s affiliates or licensees. Administrator may update your Profile as necessary to correct contract ID numbers.</li>\
												<li class="iso-num-list-padding"><strong>Changes to the Agreement:</strong> If Administrator decides to change or amend the Agreement, Administrator (a) will give you written notice of those changes or amendments to the Agreement, and (b) provide you with a hyperlink to an Internet website address where the revised version of the Agreement can be found. <em>Members residing in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and UK will need to consent to the revised version of the Agreement in order to be bound by it.</em> Members residing in other countries will need to discontinue using the Program when making rentals in order to decline such changes or amendments.

Without limiting anything contained in Chapter A, Section 3 (Your Profile), you expressly agree that it is your sole responsibility to keep your email address current and up-to-date and that Administrator may reasonably assume that any email sent by Administrator to the email address in your Profile will be received by you.

Each Licensee maintains its own privacy policy ("<u>Licensee Policy</u>"), and Administrator is not responsible for the information practices of any Licensee to the fullest extent permitted by law.

														<li class="iso-subsection"><strong>For Members residing in any other countries:</strong><br /><br /> Administrator shall not be liable to Member for any incidental, indirect, consequential, special, or punitive damages, or lost profits, goodwill, savings, or use, of any kind or nature arising out of, or relating to the performance, breach, or termination of this Agreement or any services, whether such damage or loss is foreseeable or not, whether Member has been advised of the possibility thereof or not, and whether such liability is asserted on the basis of contract, tort (including negligence or strict liability), or otherwise.<br /><br />\

												<li class="iso-num-list-padding"><strong>Rental agreements:</strong> Program membership does not guarantee your ability to rent vehicles from Administrator\'s affiliates or licensees. All rentals remain subject and subordinate to availability and any applicable qualifications and rental conditions. For example, the minimum or maximum age to rent may vary by country. See rental policies for renting location. In addition, all reservation requests are non-binding for the Member and the corresponding affiliate or licensee of Administrator. There is no no-show penalty for the Member (except Fixed Based Operator deliveries); the corresponding affiliate or licensee of Administrator is also not required to keep the vehicle available.</li>\

														<li class="iso-num-list-padding iso-subsection">The Member has the right to terminate enrollment in the Program at any time by giving notice to Administrator. Administrator reserves the right to terminate a membership at any time for good cause, including but not limited to a serious violation of this Agreement, a serious violation of any rental contract, harassment or other abusive behavior towards employees or customers of Administrator, its affiliates or licensees, failure to obey the instructions of Administrator\'s, its affiliate\'s or licensee\'s staff in charge, failure to pay any balance due for rentals, or fraudulent activity of the Member, by giving notice. The Member\'s right to terminate for good cause remains unaffected.</li>\
														<li class="iso-num-list-padding iso-subsection"><em>In case of termination or non-renewal of membership of a Member residing in Austria, Denmark, and Germany, the rental credits and Free Days shall remain valid for the time period governed in Section 8 of this Chapter B below.

In the event that you enroll in certain Partner Reward Programs, you hereby authorize Administrator to collect an applicable Frequent Traveler Recovery Fee (Freq Trav Rec Fee) as further specified to you in the enrollment process or if you modify your profile to add a Partner Rewards Program. The Frequent Traveler Recovery Fee (Freq Trav Rec Fee) applies to qualifying rentals in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico when the Renter chooses to earn miles/points in certain Partner Rewards Programs. The Frequent Traveler Recovery Fee offsets a portion of the expense paid by Administrator to the applicable Partner Rewards Program when Administrator purchases said miles/points. You may also be subject to additional restrictions and rules imposed by each partner\'s own Partner Rewards Program rules. A list of the Frequent Traveler Recovery Fees collected by Administrator is available atnationalcar.com. The fees may be in addition to any other fees or charges the airline, hotel or other partner may impose in connection with your use or redemption of any earned miles, points or other form of reward.

FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, “RENTER” ALSO INCLUDES ANY AUTHORIZED DRIVER UNDER THE AGREEMENT, AND ANY OF RENTER’S AGENTS, BENEFICIARIES OR ASSIGNS, OR ANYONE ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FOREGOING, AND “OWNER” ALSO INCLUDES ANY OF ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, BENEFICIARIES, ASSIGNS, AND VENDORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND MARKETING PARTNERS. RENTER AND OWNER AGREE THAT NO CLAIMS WILL BE PURSUED OR RESOLVED AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, THAT NO ARBITRATION FORUM WILL HAVE JURISDICTION TO DECIDE ANY CLAIMS ON A CLASS-WIDE, COLLECTIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS, AND THAT NO RULES OR OTHER PROCEDURES FOR CLASS-WIDE OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION WILL APPLY. This Dispute Resolution Provision is to be broadly interpreted and applies to all Claims based in contract, tort, statute, or any other legal theory, and all Claims that arose prior to or after termination of the Rental Agreement. However, the parties agree that either party may bring an individual action in a small claims court with valid jurisdiction, provided that the action remains in that court (other than any appeal of the small claims court ruling), is made on behalf of or against Renter only and is not made part of a class action, private attorney general action or other representative or collective action. The parties also agree that claims against or by a third-party insurance company ostensibly providing coverage to Renter or any AAD or the application of Owner’s financial responsibility relating to the use or operation of Vehicle may be brought in a court with valid jurisdiction.<br />\
													(1) Procedure. A party must send a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing (a) the nature and basis of the claim; and (b) the relief sought, to the other party. The Notice to Owner should be addressed to: CT Corporation, 208 S LaSalle, Suite 814, Chicago, IL 60604 (“Notice Address”). If Owner and Renter do not resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, a party may commence an arbitration by filing a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules. Claims will be resolved pursuant to the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of the demand, as modified by this agreement. However, a single arbitrator will be selected according to AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by Renter or by Owner that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The AAA rules are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. Except as required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any dispute or arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.<br />\
													(2) Arbitrator’s Authority: The arbitrator is bound by this Agreement, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator has no authority to join or consolidate claims, or adjudicate joined and consolidated claims. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including whether it is void. The parties agree that the arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding and may be confirmed or challenged in any court with jurisdiction as permitted under the FAA. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court, but only in favor of an individual party and for a party’s individual claim.<br />\
													(3) Arbitration Costs: Renter will be responsible for his/her share of any arbitration fees (e.g., filing, administrative, etc.), but only up to the amount of filing fees Renter would incur if the claims were filed in court. Owner will be responsible for all additional arbitration fees. Renter is responsible for all other costs/fees that it incurs in arbitration, e.g., fees for attorneys, expert witnesses, etc. Renter will not be required to reimburse Owner for any fees unless the arbitrator finds that the substance of Renter’s claim(s) or the relief sought is frivolous. If the arbitrator makes such a finding, AAA Rules will govern the payment of all fees, and Owner may seek reasonable attorney’s fees. Owner will pay all fees and costs it is required by law to pay.<br />\
													(4) Governing Law and Enforcement: Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 24, this Dispute Resolution Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the FAA, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. This Dispute Resolution Provision was drafted in compliance with the laws in all states, however, if any portion of it is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable or is found not to apply to a claim, the remainder of this Dispute Resolution Provision remains in full force and effect. Except, if the class-arbitration waiver provision is deemed unenforceable, any class action claim(s) must proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction.\
